%%% process_encoding_model_v2.m: NOT the same as the original. Main
%%% difference is it outputs B_all and pred_inds_cell_opt
%%% process_encoding model in the witten lab cup! 
%%%
%%% Description: Process the encoding model on a matrix of predictors belonging to different behavioral variables and a matrix of neural activity traces correspoding to one or more neurons. return the relative
%%% contribution of each behavioral variable to each neuron and the F-statistic derived from a nested model comparison for each behavioral variable and neuron to determine if the behavioral variable is 
%%% significantly represented in the neuron's activity.
%
% arguments: pred_allmat      - cell array correspoding to a matrix of behavioral predictors, each term is a trial and contains a matrix where rows are timepoints and columns are behavioral predictors.
%            pred_inds_cell   - cell array where each term has a vector of indices of the predictors that belong to a specific behavioral variable
%            neural_act_mat   - cell array correspoding to a matrix of activity traces, each term is a trial and contains a matrix where rows are timepoints and columns are traces correspoding to different
%                               neurons. Timepoints where the neuronal activity is not defined (e.g. a the imaging became unstable) are filled with NaNs (Currently it is assumed that before the first NaN
%                               activity was always defined, and after the first NaN activity is never defined).
%            pred_types_cell  - cell array where each terms indicates the type of behavioral variable ('event', 'whole-trial', or 'continuous').
%            approach         - 'norefit': calculate regression weights with the full model, then zero the weights correspoding to the predictors being dropped. 'refit' : calculate regression weights
%                               without the weights correspoding to the predictors being dropped (partial model).
%            trial_types_to_match - If it is desired to match the effects on the regression of trials of different types, then this argument should be a vector the same length as pred_allmat where each term is 
%                                   a number denoting trial type. 
%            cont_polydeg_det - If instead of finding the optimal polynomical degree for each continuous variable we want to set it to a determined degree
%
% outputs:   relative_contrib - a matrix where rows are behavioral variables and columns are neurons. each term is the relative contribution of the behavioral variable to the neural activity.
%            Fstat_mat        - a matrix where rows are behavioral variables and columns are neurons. each term is the F-statistic associated with the nested model comparison where the predicted variable is the
%                               activity of the neuron, the full model is the model containing the predictors from al behavioral variables, and the partial model is the model containing the predictors from all
%                               variables except the one being tested. The value of this statistic shoudl be compared to a distirbution of staitsitc values obtained by erforing the same oprateion on shuffled 
%                               data, directly using the p-value assocaited with the staitstic is not valid given the autocorrelations in the data.
%            full_R2_vec      - a vector indicating the R2 of the full model for each neuron.
%            B_all            - cell array with predictor weights for each neuron calculated by performing the regression on all data (without crossvalidation).
%            pred_inds_cell_opt - cell array where each term corresponds to a neuron and contains a cell array where each term has a vector of indices of the predictors that belong to a specific behavioral 
%                                 variable, updated to reflect the optimal model for the given neuron.
